    <p>The main purpose of our site is to allow anyone to write comfort letters to the pro-
files on the website. While doing research on the mournig and grieving process we
noticed that one of the biggest factors that keeps a person in pain after loss is the
inability to have a conversation with others. With this system we allow people to
give some encouragin/comforting words to those in pain, and if they chose to they
can become like pen-pals. We believe that this little, simple, human interaction can
sometimes make a persons life, or at the very least their day, a bit better. Below
you will see a blank space, you can write your letter there. After sending out the
mail it will go under revision and then an email will be sent back telling you wheth-
er or not the mail has gone through.</p>
